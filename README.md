[ProjectEurler](https://projecteuler.net/)  is a website that offers a collection of mathematical challenges that can be solved through algorithmic programming.
In my spare time, I tackle these challenges one by one, using different programming languages - trying to nudge myself out of my cozy C# comfort zone.

I solve these problems quickly, though not always efficiently, with a focus on getting results. However, you might spot some improvements over time as I get better at this!
